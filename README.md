![workflow](./assets/gifs/workflow.gif)	

## What Does it do

When a pull request is merged to the target branch, the action will trigger a workflow to update the linked work items state to its next state. For example, if the Work Item's state is in **ToDo**, the work item's state will change to **doing**. The action supports both default and custom process templates as well.

## Supported Pull Request :arrows_clockwise: States

The action currently supports **closed** state. Support for other pull request states will be added soon.

## Prerequisites

- Azure DevOps account
- Azure DevOps PAT
- GitHub Account
- GitHub PAT
- Install the [Azure Boards App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/install-github-app?view=azure-devops) from GitHub Marketplace

## Example Usage

1. Add the following as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in your repository.

    - Azure DevOps PAT 
    - GitHub PAT
    - Azure DevOps Organization 
    - Azure DevOps Project

2. Other Input Parameters

    - **closedstate**- This Parameter is **required** for the action to check the workitem state. If the target workitem's state is closed, the action will quit. This is to ensure that a closed work item is not linked to a pull request.

    - **gh_repo, gh_repo_owner**- To get the latest pull request details	

    - **pull_number**- value of this parameter is obtained from the GitHub event **${{github.event.number}}**


### WorkFlow Process

1. Get the Work Item Id

   - With the github repository inputs, a request is sent to the pull request api endpoint to get the complete pull request details
   - From the pull request details the work item id is retrieved

2. Update the Work Item State

   - With the Work Item and the ADO Project Name, the work item states associated with the Project are pulled. 
   - At first, the check will be done whether the work item is in closed state. If not, the workitem state is updated to the next state.

### Link the Work Item

The work Item Id must be prefixed with AB and added as **AB#[Workitem Id]** in the Pull request body. Linking your workitem in your pull request is mandatory, if no workitem is found the action will produce an error.
